# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem.

## Key Components:

- Base Case: The condition under which the recursion ends.
- Recursive Case: The condition under which the function calls itself to continue the recursion.

## Origin

Recursion has been a fundamental concept in mathematics, utilized for functions and problem solving, well-documented in the works of mathematicians like GÃ¶del and Turing.

## Functional Programming:

In languages like Haskell and Scala, recursion replaces loops for repeating computations, aligning with the immutability and statelessness of functional paradigms.

- Example to mention:
  The factorial function in Haskell, showcasing how functional languages naturally express recursive operations.

## When and Why to Use Recursion:

### Ideal Use Cases:

Problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same type, such as sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (binary search), and computational problems (Fibonacci numbers).

### Implementation Strategy:

- Identify the base case: The simplest, smallest scenario which can be solved directly.

- Define the recursive case: How to reduce the problem in each step towards eventually reaching the base case.

# Exercises Cases

When you're implementing the exercises, feel free to use the exercises here:

- [Factorial](./0-factorial.c)
  Most basic example of recursion, calculating the factorial of a number. Used to explain the concept of base case and recursive case.

- [Reverse String](./1-reverse-string.c)
  A simple example of recursion, reversing a string. The objective is to reverse a string using recursion.

- [Fibonacci](./2-fibonacci.c)
  A classic example of recursion, calculating the Fibonacci sequence, the objective is to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Which is the sum of the two previous numbers.
