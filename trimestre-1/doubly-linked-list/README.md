# Double Linked List

## Objective

The objective for the today's space is:

- Discuss what is a `Double Linked List`
- Understand how to create and use a `Double Linked List`

## Introduction

### Origin and History

Just as [Linked List](../linkedList/README.md), the concept of a double linked list was first described by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon at the RAND Corporation as part of their work on the Logic Theory Machine, which was an early AI program in mid of 1950s.

### importance in Computer Science

- Doubly linked lists are fundamental to understanding dynamic data structures and memory management.

- They form the basis for more complex data structures like dequeues, which are used in various algorithms and systems

## When and how to use Double Linked List

- Bidirectional Traversal: When you need to traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.

- Frequent Insertions/Deletions: When you need to frequently insert or delete elements at both ends or in the middle of the list.

- Efficient Operations: Doubly linked lists offer efficient insertions and deletions from both ends of the list.

## Exercises

1. Append a Node to the End:

Write a function to append a new node with given data to the end of the doubly linked list.

2. Insert a Node at a Specific Position:

Write a function to insert a new node with given data at a specific position in the doubly linked list.

3. Delete a Node by Value:

Write a function to delete the first node in the doubly linked list that contains a given value.

4. Reverse the Doubly Linked List:

Write a function to reverse the doubly linked list.

5. Find the Length of the Doubly Linked List:

Write a function to find the length of the doubly linked list.
