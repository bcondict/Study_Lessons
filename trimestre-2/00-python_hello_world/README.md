## Origin and Story

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It was designed to be easy to read and simple to implement. Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and many others fields.

## What is Python and How to Use It

### What is it

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented and functional programming.

### How to use it

- **Installing Python**:

  - Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - Using CLI: `sudo apt-get install python3` (for Linux) or `brew install python3` (for macOS).
  - Verify the installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.

- **Writing and Running Python Code**:
  - Create a new Python file with a `.py` extension.
  - Write your Python code in the file.
  - Run the Python script using the python interpreter with command `python filename.py` or `python3 filename.py`.

#### Hello World Program

- Writing your Python script

  1. Create a new file named `hello.py`.
  2. Write the following code in the file:

  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```

  3. Save the file.

- running the python script
  1. run the script using the command `python hello.py` or `python3 hello.py`.
  2. The output should be `Hello, World!`.

#### Basic Python Syntax

- Comments:

  - Comments are lines that are ignored by the interpreter. They are used to explain code.
  - Single-line Comment:
    ```python
    # This is a comment
    ```

- Variables and Data Types:

  - Variables store data that can be used later in the program.
  - Example:
    ```python
    message = "Hello, World!"
    ```

- Print Function:

  - The `print()` function outputs data to the console.
  - Example:
    ```python
    print(message)
    ```

### Task For Learners

- Task 1: Modify the Hello World Program

  1. Objective:
     Change the message printed by the program.

  2. Instructions:
     - Modify `hello.py`` to print "Hello, Python!" instead of "Hello, World!".
     - Save the file and run the script again.
     - Outcome:
       Understand how to modify and rerun Python scripts.

- Task 2: Add a Comment to Your Script

  1. Objective:
     Add a comment explaining what the script does.

  2. Instructions:
     - Add a comment at the top of `hello.py` that says `# This script prints Hello, Python!`.
     - Outcome:
       Learn how to add comments to Python code.

- Task 3: Create a New Script with a Variable

  1. Objective:

  Create a new Python script that uses a variable to store a message.

  2. Instructions:

     - Write a new script called `message.py`.
     - In the script, create a variable `message` and assign it the value `"Hello, Python!"`.
     - Use the `print()` function to print the value of the `message` variable.
     - Save and run the script.

  3. Outcome:
     Practice creating and using variables in Python.
